=head1 NAME

Log::Any::Adapter::Log4cplus - Adapter to use Lib::Log4cplus with Log::Any

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.001';

=head1 SYNOPSIS
 
    use Log::Any::Adapter;
 
    Log::Any::Adapter->set('Log4cplus', file => '/path/to/log.properties');
 
    my $logger = Lib::Log4cplus->new( str => $config_string );
    Log::Any::Adapter->set('Log4cplus', logger => $logger);
 
=head1 DESCRIPTION
 
This L<Log::Any> adapter uses L<Lib::Log4cplus> for
logging.
 
You may either pass parameters (like I<outputs>) to be passed to
C<< Lib::Log4cplus->new >>, or pass a C<Lib::Log4cplus::Logger> object directly in the
I<logger> parameter.

use Log::Any::Adapter::Util qw(make_method);
use Log::Log4cplus;
use parent qw(Log::Any::Adapter::Base);

sub init
{
    my $self = shift;

    # If a dispatcher was not explicitly passed in, create a new one with the passed arguments.
    #
    $_[-2] eq "category" and splice @_, -2, 2;
    $self->{logger} ||= Log::Log4cplus->new(@_);
}

# Delegate logging methods to same methods in dispatcher
#
foreach my $method (Log::Any->logging_methods())
{
    __PACKAGE__->delegate_method_to_slot('logger', $method, $method);
}

# Delegate detection methods to would_log
#
foreach my $method (Log::Any->detection_methods())
{
    __PACKAGE__->delegate_method_to_slot('logger', $method, $method);
